# Filestore — S3/R2-Compatible Object Store for File Attachments

## Problem

When a user attaches a file that OAB cannot inline into the prompt — either
because it's too large (text > 512 KB) or because it's an unsupported format
(PDF, ZIP, binary, etc.) — the file was previously **silently dropped**.
The agent never knew the file existed.

This affected all 7 platforms: Discord, Slack, Telegram, Feishu, Google Chat,
WeCom, and LINE.

PR #1346 proposed returning the platform's raw URL as a hint, but this has
fundamental limitations:

| Platform | Issue |
|----------|-------|
| Discord | CDN URLs expire in ~24 hours |
| Slack | `url_private_download` requires a Bearer token the agent does not have |
| Any | Agent may lack web-fetch capability or network access to platform CDNs |

## Solution

The `[filestore]` feature solves all three issues:

```
User attaches large text file (> 512 KB)
  → OAB downloads using its platform token (Slack Bearer / Discord CDN)
  → Uploads to user-configured S3/R2 bucket
  → Generates a presigned GET URL (configurable TTL)
  → Returns a ContentBlock::Text hint with the presigned URL
  → Agent fetches via bare HTTP GET (no auth needed)
```

Key insight: **OAB already has the platform credentials to download the file** —
it just wasn't using them for files above the inline limit.

## Configuration

Add a `[filestore]` section to your `config.toml`:

```toml
[filestore]
bucket = "my-oab-files"
region = "us-west-2"
prefix = "incoming/"       # object key prefix (default)
presigned_ttl = 3600       # URL expiry in seconds (default: 1 hour)
```

### With Cloudflare R2

**Recommended: use secret refs** (credentials resolved from AWS Secrets Manager
or exec provider at boot time — never stored in plaintext config):

```toml
[filestore]
bucket = "my-oab-files"
region = "auto"
endpoint = "https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
presigned_ttl = 3600
access_key_id = "${secrets.r2_access_key}"
secret_access_key = "${secrets.r2_secret_key}"

[secrets.refs]
r2_access_key = "aws-sm://openab/prod#R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
r2_secret_key = "aws-sm://openab/prod#R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
```

Alternative (env vars — acceptable for development, not recommended for production):

```toml
[filestore]
bucket = "my-oab-files"
region = "auto"
endpoint = "https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
presigned_ttl = 3600
access_key_id = "${R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID}"
secret_access_key = "${R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
```

> **Security note:** Always prefer `[secrets.refs]` over env vars for R2/S3
> credentials. Secret refs support rotation, audit trails, and are never
> exposed in process listings or environment dumps.

### With AWS S3

```toml
[filestore]
bucket = "my-oab-files"
region = "us-west-2"
presigned_ttl = 3600
# Credentials resolved via AWS provider chain (IRSA, env vars, instance role)
```

### With MinIO (self-hosted)

```toml
[filestore]
bucket = "oab-uploads"
region = "us-east-1"
endpoint = "http://minio.internal:9000"
access_key_id = "${MINIO_ACCESS_KEY}"
secret_access_key = "${MINIO_SECRET_KEY}"
presigned_ttl = 7200
```

## Technical Details

### Streaming Multipart Upload

Files are uploaded using S3 multipart upload with streaming:

- **Chunk size:** 16 MB per part (above S3 minimum of 5 MB)
- **Memory usage:** ~16 MB per concurrent upload (fixed, regardless of file size)
- **Part count:** max ~32 parts for a 500 MB file (well below S3's 10,000 limit)
- **Timeout:** 10 minutes total for the streaming upload operation

The streaming approach means a 500 MB file uses the same ~16 MB of memory as a 1 MB file on the Discord/Slack streaming path. Gateway adapters use buffered single PUT (see Platform-Specific Behavior below).

### Platform-Specific Behavior

| Platform | Download Method | Upload Method | File Types |
|----------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Discord | Streaming download | Streaming multipart (~16 MB chunks) | Text > 512KB + PDF/ZIP/binary (videos excluded — see Behavior) |
| Slack | Streaming download | Streaming multipart (~16 MB chunks) | Text > 512KB + PDF/ZIP/binary (videos excluded — see Behavior) |
| Gateway (Telegram, Feishu, Google Chat, WeCom, LINE) | File on local disk | Single PUT | Text files delivered by adapter pipeline; binary limited by adapter validation |

Gateway adapters use their existing text-file pipeline (extension whitelist).
When filestore is configured, large text files (>512 KB) that pass through
the adapter are uploaded to S3/R2 instead of being inlined. Without filestore,
all text files are inlined regardless of size (original behavior preserved).
Full binary support requires a gateway schema change (tracked in #1349).

### Timeouts

| Operation | Timeout | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Download from platform (streaming path) | 10 minutes | HTTP request including body streaming |
| Streaming upload to S3 | 10 minutes | Total for download + all parts + complete |
| Download from platform (inline path) | 30 seconds | For files expected ≤512 KB |
| Individual part upload | SDK default | Per upload_part call |

### Incomplete Multipart Upload Cleanup

If a streaming upload is interrupted (timeout, OAB crash, network failure),
S3 may retain incomplete multipart upload parts. These consume storage until
cleaned up.

**Required:** Configure an `AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload` lifecycle rule:

```json
{
  "Rules": [{
    "ID": "abort-incomplete-uploads",
    "Filter": { "Prefix": "incoming/" },
    "Status": "Enabled",
    "AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload": { "DaysAfterInitiation": 1 }
  }]
}
```

```bash
# Apply alongside your expiry rule
aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration \
  --bucket my-oab-files \
  --lifecycle-configuration file://lifecycle.json
```

For Cloudflare R2, incomplete multipart uploads are automatically cleaned up
after 24 hours (no configuration needed).

## Behavior

> **Platform scope:**
> - **Discord / Slack:** All file types supported — text > 512KB, PDF, ZIP, binary,
>   and any unsupported format are uploaded to filestore via streaming multipart.
> - **Gateway (Telegram, Feishu, Google Chat, WeCom, LINE):** Filestore is wired for
>   files delivered by existing adapter pipelines. Large text files (>512KB) that pass
>   through the adapter are uploaded. Binary/generic-file support remains limited by
>   current gateway adapter validation (UTF-8 checks, platform-specific size limits).
>   Full binary support requires a gateway schema change tracked in follow-up #1349.

| File size | Filestore configured | Result |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| Text ≤ 512 KB | any | Inlined into prompt (unchanged) |
| Text > 512 KB | ✅ yes | Uploaded → presigned URL returned |
| PDF, ZIP, DOCX, binary (Discord/Slack only) | ✅ yes | Uploaded → presigned URL returned |
| Video (`video/*` MIME or `.mp4/.mov/.m4v/.webm/.mkv/.avi`) | any | **Never uploaded** — agent receives a `[Video attachment]` metadata block (filename, type, size, platform URL) |
| Text > 512 KB | ❌ no | Silently dropped (legacy behavior) |
| PDF, ZIP, DOCX, binary | ❌ no | Silently dropped (legacy behavior) |
| > max_file_size_mb (default 250 MB, max 500 MB) | ✅ yes | Dropped on Discord/Slack; degraded hint on gateway (see Error Handling) |

## What the Agent Sees

When a file is uploaded to the filestore, the agent receives a text block like:

```
[File: test-results.txt]
This file (1024 KB) exceeds the 512 KB inline limit. It has been uploaded to
temporary storage. Fetch the contents using the URL below:
https://my-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/incoming/abc123_test-results.txt?X-Amz-Algorithm=...
Note: this URL expires in 60 minutes.
```

The agent can then use any HTTP tool (`web-fetch`, `curl`, etc.) to download
the file — no authentication headers required.

## Security

### Credentials

- **Platform tokens (Slack/Discord)** stay server-side — never exposed to agent
- **S3 credentials** stay server-side — only used for upload + presigning
- **Presigned URLs** are time-limited and scoped to a single object

### Object Keys

Object keys are server-generated: `{prefix}{uuid}_{filename}`. The UUID
prevents collision and enumeration. The filename portion is sanitized before
being embedded in the key: path separators (`/`, `\`), traversal sequences
(`..`), double quotes, and non-ASCII characters are replaced or stripped,
and the name is capped at 200 characters.

### Filename Sanitization & Content-Disposition

- **S3 objects** are uploaded with `Content-Disposition: attachment` so
  browsers download the file instead of rendering it inline — this prevents
  HTML/JS content from executing in the bucket's origin when a presigned URL
  is opened in a browser. Double quotes are stripped from filenames so the
  header cannot be broken out of.
- **Agent-visible text** (inline file blocks and error/degraded hints) strips
  control characters from filenames and caps them at 200 characters,
  preventing prompt injection via crafted attachment filenames.

### Size Limits

- Per-file cap: configurable via `max_file_size_mb` (default 250 MB, max 500 MB)
- File count cap: 5 text files per message (unchanged)
- Aggregate inline cap: 1 MB for inlined files (filestore uploads bypass this)

### Recommended: S3 Lifecycle Rules

OAB does not delete uploaded objects. **You must configure lifecycle rules
on your bucket** to auto-expire objects, otherwise storage will grow unbounded.

> **Important:** Set your lifecycle expiry **longer** than `presigned_ttl`.
> If objects are deleted before the presigned URL expires, agents will get 404
> errors when fetching. Example: if `presigned_ttl = 3600` (1 hour), set
> lifecycle expiry to at least 24 hours.

#### AWS S3 — via CLI

Create a `lifecycle.json` file:

```json
{
  "Rules": [{
    "ID": "expire-filestore-uploads",
    "Filter": { "Prefix": "incoming/" },
    "Status": "Enabled",
    "Expiration": { "Days": 1 }
  }]
}
```

Apply it:

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration \
  --bucket my-oab-files \
  --lifecycle-configuration file://lifecycle.json
```

To verify:

```bash
aws s3api get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket my-oab-files
```

For longer retention (e.g. 30 days), change `"Days": 30`.

#### AWS S3 — via Console

1. Go to **S3 → your bucket → Management → Lifecycle rules**
2. Click **Create lifecycle rule**
3. Rule name: `expire-filestore-uploads`
4. Filter: Prefix `incoming/`
5. Actions: **Expire current versions of objects** → Days: `1` (or `30`)
6. Save

#### Cloudflare R2

R2 supports object lifecycle rules via the dashboard:

1. Go to **R2 → your bucket → Settings → Object lifecycle rules**
2. Click **Add rule**
3. Condition: Prefix matches `incoming/`
4. Action: **Delete objects** after `1 day` (or `30 days`)
5. Save

📖 Reference: [Cloudflare R2 Object Lifecycle Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/object-lifecycles/)

#### MinIO

```bash
# Set lifecycle to expire objects in incoming/ after 1 day
mc ilm rule add myminio/oab-uploads \
  --prefix "incoming/" \
  --expiry-days 1
```

📖 Reference: [MinIO Object Lifecycle Management](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/administration/object-management/object-lifecycle-management.html)

#### Recommended Expiry Settings

| Use case | Expiry | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Most deployments | 1 day | Agent fetches within minutes; 24h covers retries |
| Long-running sessions | 7 days | For agents that may revisit conversations later |
| Compliance/audit | 30 days | Keep files available for review |

### Minimum IAM Policy

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "s3:PutObject",
      "s3:GetObject",
      "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
      "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-oab-files/incoming/*"
  }]
}
```

## Error Handling

| Failure | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| S3 upload fails | Agent receives degraded hint: "file could not be uploaded to temporary storage" |
| S3 upload times out (>10 min) | Same as upload failure — degraded hint returned |
| Download from platform fails | File is dropped (warn log), agent not notified |
| Download times out (>10 min) | Same as download failure — file dropped |
| File exceeds max_file_size_mb (Discord/Slack) | File is dropped (warn log), agent not notified |
| File exceeds max_file_size_mb (gateway) | Agent receives degraded hint: "exceeds the configured upload limit and could not be stored" |
| Presigned URL generation fails | Agent receives degraded hint |
| Filestore not configured | Legacy behavior (>512KB files silently dropped) |

When filestore is configured but upload fails, the agent always receives a
hint indicating the file exists but content is unavailable. This ensures
the agent can inform the user, even if it cannot retrieve the content.

## Build Requirement

The filestore feature is **enabled by default** in standard builds. No extra
flags needed. If you need to disable it:

```bash
cargo build --no-default-features --features "discord,slack,..."
```

When built without it, the `[filestore]` config section is ignored and all
behavior is unchanged from before.

## Cost Considerations

| Backend | Storage | PUT | GET (via presigned) | Egress |
|---------|---------|-----|---------------------|--------|
| AWS S3 | $0.023/GB/mo | $0.005/1K | $0.0004/1K | $0.09/GB |
| Cloudflare R2 | $0.015/GB/mo | $0.0045/1K | Free (Class B) | **Free** |
| MinIO (self-hosted) | Disk cost | — | — | — |

For typical usage (a few large files per day, auto-expired after 24h):
- **R2**: essentially free (zero egress + negligible storage)
- **S3**: < $0.01/month for most teams

## Comparison with Alternatives

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Filestore (this)** | Works for all agents, no platform auth leakage, configurable TTL | Requires S3/R2 bucket setup |
| Raw URL hint (PR #1346) | Zero infra needed | Slack broken, Discord expires, agent needs web-fetch |
| Local filesystem | No external deps | Only works in colocate mode, no remote agents |
| OAB HTTP proxy | No bucket needed | Complex, single-instance only, needs port management |

## Future Directions

- **Structured `ContentBlock::File`** in ACP for richer metadata (mime, size, TTL)
- **Metrics** — upload success rate, latency, file size distribution
- **URL hint fallback** — when filestore is not configured, fall back to platform URL hint (PR #1346 pattern)
- **Multi-modal** — extend filestore to images/audio when inline is too large
